# autonomous-line-follower-using-reinforcement-learning
A custom simulation environment where an AI agent learns to navigate complex, randomly generated "Zig-Zag" tracks using Deep Reinforcement Learning. Unlike traditional PID controllers, this agent learns continuous control for both steering and velocity from scratch.
